bigriver tools is a collection of helper scripts for dealing with AWS. We all end up writing them, then re-writing them at the next job because they were in a corporate repo instead of open source. I hate rewriting things if I can avoid it, so here's a place to park your AWS helper scripts.

It's packaged as a ZSH plugin to make it easier to use with plugin managers. If you aren't using a ZSH plugin manager like [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) or [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), or you prefer a shell other than ZSH, install this script collection by  cloning this repo and adding the `bin` directory to your `$PATH`.

# Included Scripts

| Script | Description | Credit |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ |
| br-asg-members | Print the public and/or private DNS names for members of a given autoscaling group | jpb@unixorn.net |
| br-check-for-open-s3-buckets | Check your S3 buckets for open permissions | [Gabe Abinante](https://github.com/gabinante) |
| br-ec2-instance-dns-name | Print the public IP for a given instance ID | jpb@unixorn.net |
| br-ec2-instance-state | Print the state (running, stopped, etc) for a given instance ID | jpb@unixorn.net |
| br-who-are-you | Shows which IAM user matches a given ACCESS_KEY_ID | [Joe Gardner](https://github.com/joehack3r) |

# Usage

Inspired by how `git` runs helper tools, bigriver-tools includes a driver script `br`, which will run scripts with names starting with `br-` so you can do `br who-are-you --access-key-id XYZ` and it will run `br-who-are-you` and pass the arguments to it.
